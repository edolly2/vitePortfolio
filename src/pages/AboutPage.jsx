          <p>
            My name is Eric Dollinger. I am a 32 year old Web Developer based
            out of Omaha, Nebraska. I specialize in the Front End side using
            ReactJS but I am familiar with a lot of the Back End as well as many
            other languages, frameworks, and libraries.
          </p>

            className="about-page-show"

            <br />
            <p>
              I am mostly self taught as I started Web Development as a hobby.
              As I began to transition my hobby to more career oriented, is when
              I started to participate in classes, certifications, challenges,
              and presentations from the top Developers in the industry.
            </p>
